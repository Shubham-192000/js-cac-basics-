This project aims to develop a sarcasm detection model using deep learning techniques implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed to classify text as sarcastic or non-sarcastic by leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) algorithms.

KEY FEATURES 
1. PREDICTION WITH ACCURACY GREATER THAN 95%
   
2. USED ADAM ALGORITHM FOR BETTER OPTIMIZATION
   
3. ALGORITHM:

The sarcasm detection model is based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers. These algorithms are well-suited for sequence-based data like text and are capable of capturing the temporal dependencies and context in sentences.
 
4.Data Preprocessing:

Tokenization and Embedding: Text data is tokenized and converted into sequences of word embeddings, which capture the semantic meaning of words in a dense vector space.
Padding: Sequences are padded to ensure uniform input length for the model.

5.Model Architecture:

Embedding Layer: Converts words into word embeddings.


LSTM/GRU Layers: Capture sequential dependencies and context within the text.


Dense Layer with Activation: Final dense layer with a sigmoid activation function to output a binary classification (sarcasm vs. non-sarcasm).

6.Training Process:

The model is trained using a labeled dataset of sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences.
Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy is used as the loss function to optimize the model.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer is employed for training, providing efficient and adaptive learning rates.
Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness.

7.Deployment:

The trained model is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive web interface where users can input text and receive real-time predictions on whether the text is sarcastic.
